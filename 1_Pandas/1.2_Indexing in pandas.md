The indexing operator and attribute selection are nice because they work just like they do in the rest of the Python ecosystem. As a novice, this makes them easy to pick up and use. However, [[Pandas]] has its own accessor operators, `loc` and `iloc`. For more advanced operations, these are the ones you're supposed to be using.

### Index-based selection[](https://www.kaggle.com/code/residentmario/indexing-selecting-assigning#Index-based-selection)

[[Pandas]] indexing works in one of two paradigms. The first is **index-based selection**: selecting data based on its numerical position in the data. `iloc` follows this paradigm.

To select the first row of data in a DataFrame, we may use the following:

reviews.iloc[0]

country                                                    Italy
description    Aromas include tropical fruit, broom, brimston...
                                     ...                        
variety                                              White Blend
winery                                                   Nicosia
Name: 0, Length: 13, dtype: object

Both `loc` and `iloc` are row-first, column-second. This is the opposite of what we do in native Python, which is column-first, row-second.

This means that it's marginally easier to retrieve rows, and marginally harder to get retrieve columns. To get a column with `iloc`, we can do the following:

reviews.iloc[:, 0]

0            Italy
1         Portugal
            ...   
129969      France
129970      France
Name: country, Length: 129971, dtype: object

On its own, the `:` operator, which also comes from native Python, means "everything". When combined with other selectors, however, it can be used to indicate a range of values. For example, to select the `country` column from just the first, second, and third row, we would do:

reviews.iloc[:3, 0]

0       Italy
1    Portugal
2          US
Name: country, dtype: object

Or, to select just the second and third entries, we would do:

reviews.iloc[1:3, 0]

1    Portugal
2          US
Name: country, dtype: object

It's also possible to pass a list:

reviews.iloc[[0, 1, 2], 0]

0       Italy
1    Portugal
2          US
Name: country, dtype: object

Finally, it's worth knowing that negative numbers can be used in selection. This will start counting forwards from the _end_ of the values. So for example here are the last five elements of the dataset.

reviews.iloc[-5:]
