In Python, we can access the property of an object by accessing it as an attribute. A `book` object, for example, might have a `title` property, which we can access by calling `book.title`. Columns in a [[Pandas]] DataFrame work in much the same way.

Hence to access the `country` property of `reviews` we can use:

reviews.country

0            Italy
1         Portugal
            ...   
129969      France
129970      France
Name: country, Length: 129971, dtype: object

If we have a Python dictionary, we can access its values using the indexing (`[]`) operator. We can do the same with columns in a DataFrame:

reviews['country']

0            Italy
1         Portugal
            ...   
129969      France
129970      France
Name: country, Length: 129971, dtype: object

These are the two ways of selecting a specific Series out of a DataFrame. Neither of them is more or less syntactically valid than the other, but the indexing operator `[]` does have the advantage that it can handle column names with reserved characters in them (e.g. if we had a `country providence` column, `reviews.country providence` wouldn't work).

Doesn't a [[Pandas]] Series look kind of like a fancy dictionary? It pretty much is, so it's no surprise that, to drill down to a single specific value, we need only use the indexing operator `[]` once more:

reviews['country'][0]

'Italy'
