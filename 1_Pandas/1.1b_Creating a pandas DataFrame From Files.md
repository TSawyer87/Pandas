You can [save and load the data and labels](https://realpython.com/pandas-read-write-files/) from a [[Pandas]] DataFrame to and from a number of file types, including CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, and more. This is a very powerful feature.

You can save your job candidate DataFrame to a [CSV file](https://realpython.com/python-csv/) with [`.to_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html):

`>>> df.to_csv('data.csv')`

The statement above will produce a [CSV file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) called `data.csv` in your working directory:

`,name,city,age,py-score 101,Xavier,Mexico City,41,88.0 102,Ann,Toronto,28,79.0 103,Jana,Prague,33,81.0 104,Yi,Shanghai,34,80.0 105,Robin,Manchester,38,68.0 106,Amal,Cairo,31,61.0 107,Nori,Osaka,37,84.0`

Now that you have a CSV file with data, you can load it with [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html):

`>>> pd.read_csv('data.csv', index_col=0)        name         city  age  py-score 101  Xavier  Mexico City   41      88.0 102     Ann      Toronto   28      79.0 103    Jana       Prague   33      81.0 104      Yi     Shanghai   34      80.0 105   Robin   Manchester   38      68.0 106    Amal        Cairo   31      61.0 107    Nori        Osaka   37      84.0`

Thatâ€™s how you get a [[Pandas]] DataFrame from a file. In this case, `index_col=0` specifies that the row labels are located in the first column of the CSV file.
