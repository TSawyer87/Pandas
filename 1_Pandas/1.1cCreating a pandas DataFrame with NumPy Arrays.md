You can pass a two-dimensional NumPy array to the `DataFrame` constructor the same way you do with a list:

`>`>>> arr = np.array([[1, 2, 100], ...                 [2, 4, 100], ...                 [3, 8, 100]])  >>> df_ = pd.DataFrame(arr, columns=['x', 'y', 'z']) >>> df_    x  y    z 0  1  2  100 1  2  4  100 2  3  8  100`
Although this example looks almost the same as the nested list implementation above, it has one advantage: You can specify the optional parameter `copy`.

When `copy` is set to `False` (its default setting), the data from the NumPy array isn’t copied. This means that the original data from the array is assigned to the [[Pandas]] DataFrame. If you modify the array, then your DataFrame will change too:

`>>> arr[0, 0] = 1000  >>> df_       x  y    z 0  1000  2  100 1     2  4  100 2     3  8  100`

As you can see, when you change the first item of `arr`, you also modify `df_`.

**Note:** Not copying data values can save you a significant amount of time and processing power when working with large datasets.

If this behavior isn’t what you want, then you should specify `copy=True` in the `DataFrame` constructor. That way, `df_` will be created with a copy of the values from `arr` instead of the actual values.
